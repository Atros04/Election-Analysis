## Reson for Audit

The current digital voting trend blended with paper ballots makes the system of voting we currently have in place have a dire need for integrity and verification. While we are not expressly saying that the system is fradulent, we need safeguards to ensure fraud is not occuring. In this audit, we take a look at a handful of Colorado's counties to verify the voter turnout is matched with the ballots counted.

##Audit Summary
Commissioners, we currently are in a prescident where our democracy is evolving to meet with the demand that the last 2 years have put on this country. We need to ensure everyone's voice is heard and that no one is trying to tip the scales in anyone's favor. This script has shown in small scale that we can audit a selection of counties in the state. Since we have formatted it to be usable with new data and information, we can ramp up the data to be state-wide. This script will process all counties in national elections while also being relevant for the smaller elections. For those smaller elections, we can add sections of code to index down the city level making so the audit can be performed across the board.

For example, I can add loops within the data files to separate candidates from local and national elections.
